If Bunifu UI gives problems for Forms 1 and 2, please tick the Trial tickbox and use email dulltag233@gmail.com

===========================================
If the compilator is having problems with the "using Excel = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel;" line in Form1.cs,
you might need to install Excell Interop.

To do that, go to Solution Explorer, right click on References --> Manage NuGet Packages and look for 
Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel by Microsoft. After installing this library, the errors should disappear and the app should run.
